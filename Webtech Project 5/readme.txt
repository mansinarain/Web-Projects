Making a mobile application , implementing Facebook API. In this i downloaded the latest version of Facebook SDK for iphone and according to the readme.mdown file  for  facebook-ios-sdk , implemented the Facebook API.

For the picture gallery, i made appropriate buttons and labels using the inbuilt interface builder in xcode.


Unzip and Open the folder homework9

Go to Folder : MyPictureGallery

To run the application go to : MyPictureGallery.xcodeproj and then Press Build and Run.

The Simulator will itself open and you can test the application.

Incase of errors, please check that the Simulator 4.2 is set to Simulator and not Device.

PLEASE DO NOT CUT AND PASTE THE TWO CONTAINED FOLDERS IN SEPARATE LOCATIONS TO RUN.MAKE SURE THEY ARE AS IT IS IN THE HOMEWORK9 FOLDER.
